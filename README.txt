This is a simple Python program to calculate various properties of a projectile 
in flight using the kinematic equations introduced in a beginners Mechanics course at university.

To run the program ensure all three files are in the same folder. Run the program from main.py, adjusting the
parameters for initial velocity, initial height, and angle.
